# Hytale

Set out on an adventure built for both creation and play. Hytale blends the freedom of a sandbox with the momentum of an RPG: explore a procedurally generated world full of dungeons, secrets, and a variety of creatures, then shape it block by block.

## Server Ports

Hytale uses a single **UDP** port for gameplay, operating over the **QUIC** transport protocol.
An optional **query port** is available for server discovery using the **Source Query Protocol**.

| Port Type        | Default |
| ---------------- | ------- |
| Game             | 5520    |
| Query (Optional) | 5521    |
